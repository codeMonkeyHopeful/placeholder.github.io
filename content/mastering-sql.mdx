## **This guide dives into essential SQL queries and techniques**

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for managing and manipulating databases. Whether you're extracting data, updating records, or analyzing information, SQL provides a variety of commands to perform these tasks efficiently. In this blog post, we'll explore some fundamental SQL queries using an example database with tables like `employees`, `salaries`, and `titles`.

****Basic SELECT Statements****

To retrieve all records from a table, the `SELECT *` statement is used:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
SELECT * FROM salaries;
```
If you only need specific columns, you can specify them in the `SELECT` statement:

```sql
SELECT emp_no FROM employees;

SELECT birth_date, first_name, emp_no
FROM employees;
```

****Aliasing Columns****

Sometimes, you may want to rename columns in your query results for better readability. This is done using the `AS` keyword:

```sql
SELECT emp_no AS "Personalnummer", title
FROM titles;
```

***Removing Duplicates***

The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that only unique values are returned:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT title
FROM titles;

SELECT DISTINCT first_name AS "Vorname"
FROM employees;
```

****Filtering Data with WHERE Clause****

The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records based on specific conditions:

```sql
SELECT first_name, birth_date
FROM employees
WHERE birth_date = '1960-04-15';

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE last_name = 'Bale' AND gender = 'F';

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE last_name = 'Bale' AND gender = 'F' AND first_name = 'Lena';
```

****Using IN for Multiple Values****

The `IN` keyword provides a concise way to specify multiple values in a `WHERE` clause:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM titles
WHERE title IN ('Engineer', 'Senior Engineer', 'Assistant Engineer')
  AND to_date = '9999-01-01';

SELECT *
FROM titles
WHERE title IN ('Staff', 'Senior Staff')
  AND from_date = '1995-12-03';
```

****Comparison Operators****

SQL supports various comparison operators to refine your queries further:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM titles
WHERE title IN ('Staff', 'Senior Staff')
  AND from_date < '1995-12-03'; // Can also use >, !=, >=, etc.

SELECT *
FROM titles
WHERE title IN ('Staff', 'Senior Staff')
  AND from_date BETWEEN '1995-12-03' AND '2002-12-31';

SELECT *
FROM titles
WHERE title NOT IN ('Staff', 'Senior Staff')
  AND from_date BETWEEN '1995-12-03' AND '2002-12-31';
```

****Pattern Matching with LIKE****

The `LIKE` operator is used for pattern matching in SQL:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees 
WHERE first_name LIKE 'G%'; // Matches any first name starting with 'G'

SELECT *
FROM employees 
WHERE hire_date LIKE '1995%'; // Matches any hire date in the year 1995

SELECT *
FROM employees 
WHERE first_name NOT LIKE 'G%'; // Excludes any first name starting with 'G'
```

****Aggregating Data****

SQL provides aggregation functions like `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, and `AVG` to perform calculations on your data:

```sql
SELECT count(*)
FROM employees
WHERE gender = 'F';

SELECT
  emp_no AS "Personalnummer",
  count(*) AS "Gehälter",
  max(salary) AS "Höchste_Gehalt",
  min(salary) AS "Kleinste_Gehalt",
  max(salary) - min(salary) AS "Gehaltsdifferenz",
  avg(salary) AS "Durschnittsgehalt"
FROM salaries
GROUP BY emp_no;
```

****Understanding GROUP BY****

The `GROUP BY` clause is used in conjunction with aggregate functions (such as `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `AVG`, etc.) to group the result set by one or more columns. This allows you to perform aggregations on each group of data separately.

For example, in the query:

```sql
SELECT
  emp_no AS "Personalnummer",
  count(*) AS "Gehälter",
  max(salary) AS "Höchste_Gehalt",
  min(salary) AS "Kleinste_Gehalt",
  max(salary) - min(salary) AS "Gehaltsdifferenz",
  avg(salary) AS "Durschnittsgehalt"
FROM salaries
GROUP BY emp_no;
```

This query groups the `salaries` table by the `emp_no` column. For each `emp_no`, it calculates:

- The total number of salaries (`count(*) AS "Gehälter"`),
- The highest salary (`max(salary) AS "Höchste_Gehalt"`),
- The lowest salary (`min(salary) AS "Kleinste_Gehalt"`),
- The difference between the highest and lowest salary (`max(salary) - min(salary) AS "Gehaltsdifferenz"`),
- The average salary (`avg(salary) AS "Durschnittsgehalt"`).


You can also filter aggregated results using the `HAVING` clause:

```sql
SELECT
  emp_no AS "Personalnummer",
  count(*) AS "Gehälter",
  max(salary) AS "Höchste_Gehalt"
FROM salaries
WHERE emp_no > 10300
GROUP BY emp_no
HAVING max(salary) > 100000;
```

****Joining Tables****

SQL joins allow you to combine records from two or more tables based on related columns:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN salaries s ON e.emp_no = s.emp_no;

SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name,
  salary
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN salaries s ON e.emp_no = s.emp_no
WHERE salary > 100000 AND to_date = '9999-01-01';

SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name,
  salary,
  title
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN salaries s ON e.emp_no = s.emp_no
INNER JOIN titles t ON e.emp_no = t.emp_no
WHERE salary > 100000 AND s.to_date = '9999-01-01'
  AND t.to_date = '9999-01-01';

SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name,
  salary,
  title
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN salaries s ON e.emp_no = s.emp_no
INNER JOIN titles t ON e.emp_no = t.emp_no
INNER JOIN dept_manager dm ON e.emp_no = dm.emp_no
WHERE salary > 100000 AND s.to_date = '9999-01-01'
  AND t.to_date = '9999-01-01'
  AND dm.to_date = '9999-01-01';
```

****Working with Left and Right Joins****

Left and right joins include all records from one table and the matched records from the other:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN salaries s ON e.emp_no = s.emp_no;

SELECT *
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN salaries s ON e.emp_no = s.emp_no
WHERE s.emp_no IS NULL;

SELECT *
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN salaries s ON e.emp_no = s.emp_no;
```

****Creating and Modifying Tables****

Creating and modifying database structures is another crucial aspect of SQL:

```sql
-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE Cars;

-- Use the newly created database
USE Cars;

-- Create the table with specified columns
CREATE TABLE CarDetails (
    CarID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Make VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Model VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Year INT NOT NULL,
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
);

-- Insert sample data into the table
INSERT INTO CarDetails (Make, Model, Year, Price)
VALUES
    ('Toyota', 'Camry', 2020, 24000.00),
    ('Honda', 'Civic', 2019, 22000.00),
    ('Ford', 'Mustang', 2021, 26000.00),
    ('Chevrolet', 'Malibu', 2018, 21000.00);
```

To add a new column and update existing rows with random colors:

```sql
-- Add a new column
ALTER TABLE CarDetails
ADD COLUMN Color VARCHAR(20);

-- Temporarily disable safe update mode
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;

-- Updating rows with random colors
SET @colors = 'Red,Blue,Green,Black,White,Silver,Gray';

-- Split the colors into a temporary table
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE TempColors (Color VARCHAR(20));

-- Insert colors into the temporary table
INSERT INTO TempColors (Color)
SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(@colors, ',', numbers.n), ',', -1) 
FROM (
    SELECT 1 n UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4 
    UNION ALL SELECT 5 UNION ALL SELECT 6 UNION ALL SELECT 7
) numbers;

-- Update CarDetails with random colors
UPDATE CarDetails 
SET Color = (
    SELECT Color 
    FROM TempColors 
    ORDER BY RAND() 
    LIMIT 1
);

-- Drop the temporary table
DROP TEMPORARY TABLE TempColors;

-- Re-enable safe update mode
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;
```

To update specific rows and delete records, you can use the `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements:

```sql
UPDATE CarDetails
SET Color = 'Silver'
WHERE CarID = 1;

DELETE FROM CarDetails
WHERE CarID = 2;
```
